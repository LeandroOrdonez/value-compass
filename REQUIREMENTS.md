**Project: "Value Compass" - Stock Valuation & Analysis Tool**

**Goal:** To develop a web application that helps users identify undervalued stocks based on a customizable scoring system, using financial indicators, historical data, and peer comparisons, with a flexible data source architecture.

**Target Audience:** Individual investors seeking data-driven insights for long-term investment decisions.

**Technology Stack:**

* **Backend:** Python (Flask or FastAPI), Microservice architecture.
* **Frontend:** Next.js (React).
* **Database:** PostgreSQL (or similar relational database).
* **Data Source:** Abstracted Data Service with adapter pattern (initial prototype: Yahoo Finance).
* **Containerization:** Docker.
* **Orchestration:** Kubernetes (optional, but recommended for scalability).

**Microservice Architecture:**

1.  **Data Service (Abstracted):**
    * Responsibilities: Fetching and storing financial data from configurable external APIs via adapter pattern.
    * Endpoints:
        * `/stocks/{ticker}/historical`: Returns historical data for a given stock (abstracted).
        * `/stocks/{ticker}/financials`: Returns current financial ratios and metrics (abstracted).
        * `/industry/{industry}/peers`: Returns a list of peer companies for a given industry (abstracted).
    * Implementation:
        * Define abstract interfaces for data retrieval.
        * Implement adapters for Yahoo Finance (initial) and future data sources.
        * Configuration-driven data source selection.
        * Data normalization layer.
2.  **Valuation Service:**
    * Responsibilities: Calculating valuation scores based on user-defined criteria.
    * Endpoints:
        * `/valuation/score`: Calculates and returns valuation scores for a list of stocks.
        * `/valuation/custom`: Allows users to define and save custom scoring rules.
    * This service will receive normalized data from the Data service.
3.  **User Service:**
    * Responsibilities: User authentication, authorization, and profile management.
    * Endpoints:
        * `/users/register`: Registers a new user.
        * `/users/login`: Authenticates a user.
        * `/users/portfolio`: Manages user portfolios.
        * `/users/customBaskets`: Manages custom stock baskets.
4.  **Report Service:**
    * Responsibilities: Generating monthly snapshot reports and sending alerts.
    * Endpoints:
        * `/reports/generate`: Generates a monthly report for a given portfolio.
        * `/alerts/set`: Sets up alerts for specific stocks or events.
    * This service will be schedule based, to generate reports monthly.

**Frontend Requirements (Next.js/React):**

* **User Interface:**
    * Clean and intuitive dashboard displaying portfolio performance, valuation scores, and news.
    * Interactive charts and graphs visualizing financial data.
    * Customizable stock basket creation and management.
    * Portfolio integration and management.
    * Alert setup and management.
    * Monthly report display.
* **Functionality:**
    * User authentication and authorization.
    * Real-time data updates.
    * Responsive design for mobile and desktop.

**Backend Requirements (Python):**

* **API Development:**
    * Develop RESTful APIs for each microservice.
    * Implement data validation and error handling.
    * Ensure API security and authentication.
* **Data Processing:**
    * Implement efficient algorithms for calculating valuation scores.
    * Integrate with the abstracted Data Service.
    * Store and retrieve data from the database.
* **Scalability & Reliability:**
    * Design for scalability and high availability.
    * Implement logging and monitoring.
    * Containerize the application.

**Database Requirements (PostgreSQL):**

* **Data Modeling:**
    * Design a relational database schema to store stock data, user data, and portfolio information.
    * Ensure data integrity and consistency.
* **Performance:**
    * Optimize database queries for performance.
    * Implement database indexing.

**Non-Functional Requirements:**

* **Performance:** The application should load quickly and respond to user interactions in a timely manner.
* **Security:** The application should be secure and protect user data.
* **Scalability:** The application should be able to handle a growing number of users and data.
* **Maintainability:** The codebase should be well-organized and easy to maintain.

**Development Process:**

* Agile development methodology (e.g., Scrum).
* Version control (Git).
* Automated testing (unit, integration, and end-to-end).
* Continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD).

**Data Source Extensibility:**

* Implement an adapter pattern for data source integration.
* Ensure data normalization across different data sources.
* Provide configuration options for selecting data sources.
* Design the data service to be modular.
